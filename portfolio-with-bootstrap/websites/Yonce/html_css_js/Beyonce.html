                            Beyoncé took a hiatus from music in 2010 and took over management of her career; 
                           <cite title=" See the reference at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(Beyonc%C3%A9_album)"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_(Beyonc%C3%A9_album)" target="_blank" style="color: inherit;"> 4 (2011)</a></cite>  was subsequently mellower in tone, exploring 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul.

                            releases by its experimental production and exploration of darker themes.

                       <p> 
                           A self-described "modern-day feminist", Beyoncé's songs are often characterized by themes of love, 
                           relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment.

                            On stage, her dynamic, highly-choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 16 years, she has won 17 Grammy Awards and sold over 118 million records as a solo artist and 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Recording Industry Association of America recognized Beyoncé as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade.

                        <p>
                            In 2009, <cite title="See the reference at http://www.billboard.com/"><a href="http://www.billboard.com/" target="_blank" style="color: inherit;">Billboard</a></cite> named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium in 2011.
